## Monokai color theme for Qt Creator

The color theme is based on the monokai theme for TextMate. The colors
definitions have been taken from Vim's [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
color scheme.


#### Installation

Copy `monokai.xml` file into color scheme directory:
```bash
cp monokai.xml $HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/styles
```

In Qt Creator go to _Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> Font & Colors_ and
select Monokai under "Color Scheme".
